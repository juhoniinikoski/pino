<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üöÄ About The Project

Track your learning progress to fulfill your dreams. Everywhere.

Vision for Flidi is to be the platform, that connects people who are eager to learn, despite their location. It brings together communities interested in learning the same topics, as well as giving an opportunity to get out of the box to widen the scope of knowledge.

Create question stacks, follow the tag channels and track your learning with statistics. That's Flidi.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Current status

Currently, the main focus on building the product is in the API. We are building a GraphQL API that will serve our mobile client as well as web client in the future. Check the API docs [here](https://github.com/juhoniinikoski/flidi/tree/main/server).
